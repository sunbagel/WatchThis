# WatchThis!

## What is "WatchThis!" ?
WatchThis! is a fun Chrome Extension that inserts an "assistant" into your browser. It is based off the character Jett from the game Valorant, who will interact with elements in your browser. She runs around the browser, crashing into and destroying elements as she sees fit, causing an entertaining mess for the user. This project was made mostly with Javascript, where I messed around with the DOM and made use of the Anime.js API to create smooth animations.

Along with my friend who made the art and animations, I made this project over the course of a little more than a day at the [Hackapalooza](https://github.com/GoldinGuy/Hackapalooza/blob/master/README.md#-funniest-watch-this) hackathon, winning the "Funniest Hack" award. We unfortunately didn't implement all the features we wanted, but I hope to get back on this project someday and finish it.
